		<p class="content_header_text">BEGINNER FRIENDLY</p>
		<p class="content_text">&emsp;For a beginner, golf can be too competitive, stuffy, and very intimidating. There are way too many complicated rules and expectations. Relax. There may be a time when you want to keep score, know all the rules, or play in a tournament, but until that time comes, try these suggestions:</p>
		<ul class="content_text">
			<p>Don’t keep score.</p>
			<p>Play from the short tees.</p>
			<p>Only count shots when you hit the ball.</p>
			<p>Play in your tennis shoes; be comfortable.</p>
			<p>Move your ball away from trees and rocks.</p>
			<p>Skip a hole if you need a break.</p>
			<p>Just chip and putt if you want to.</p>
		</ul>
		<p class="content_text">Squaw Creek Golf Course offers “on course” lessons to help you feel more comfortable on the course. A member of our staff will go with you onto the course to learn basic etiquette and rules. These lessons are free of charge. Call us at 817-441-8185 and schedule yours today!</p>
