# Case Project for CIS420 DeVry University

--Case Project Task--

Squaw Creeks wants to provide a web site that has a look and feel like the following golf course website http://www.oesteranch.com , which is one of its competitors.  Squaw Creek currently has a web presence here http://cera-fw.org/golf/, which is part of a fitness center company site.  Squaw Creek wants the site to include hours of operation, location, an online calendar (a free ware calendar can be incorporated into the site, www.localendar.com is one example), well design photo gallery (can be general golf stock photos, or photos provided by the instructor, the ability to buy golf balls online (using a database, but actual transaction can be “fake” purchases),  the ability to sign up for membership and the course monthly email letter).   The CERA and Squaw Creek logos from  http://cera-fw.org/golf/  should be included in the top banner.

--Major Software Components--

1.	Basic HTML for the site
2.	Nice implementation of photo gallery using JavaScript and/or jQuery or similar capability
3.	Database that houses the golf balls for sale and membership / email requests
4.	Incorporation of a calendar that has administrator priviledges for adding events.  Include a few “fake” events to demonstrate this capability.
5.	Good use of CSS for a common them throughout the site

--My Role--

For the case project I handled all of the front-end aspects of the website (these were designed around a 1920x1080 resolution monitor), acted as the project's Team Leader, and assisted with some ASP.NET and C# aspects.
